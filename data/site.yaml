            - Built new features and fixed bugs for a Symfony based application with an Angular and React front-end.
            - Implemented feature usage limit auto upgrading to allow customers to seamlessly continue using application features without having to manually initiate an upgrade process.
            - Upgraded and optimized e-commerce related functionality. Updated legacy SOAP API integration with new REST API integration.
            - Worked with a team to build "Text2Apply" which allowed applicants to fill out an application via SMS. I was responsible for building a REST API client to integrate with a 3rd party SMS provider as well as extending front-end UI components with React.
            - Implemented in-app notification to notify customers when they received a SMS from a prospective hire. This was implemented via a webhook from the 3rd party SMS service.
            - Enforced 10DLC compliance by informing the user of their 10DLC status prior to performing any SMS related operation. Implemented as a modal using React and tested with the Jasmine testing framework.
            - Setup database migrations through Liquibase and built fixtures to stand-up testing databases.
            - Worked with team to implement better automated testing practices. Expanded code base to support integration testing and allow for testing against a database.

(See *OncoLife Survivorship Care Plan* below).
            - Further expanded upon the above mentioned decision tree tool by building an application with Golang and React which allowed PDF files to be populated based on how a user filled out a form. It also supported more complex rule logic with Lua scripting.

            ***Platform.CC / PBrew*** (Golang[v2]/Python[v1])<br>
            *https://github.com/chompy/platform_cc*

            Application for provisioning apps with Docker based on Platform.sh's spec. Meant as a tool to be used for local development.
            Later PBrew was created, a tool that accomplished the same task but instead of Docker it used Homebrew to manage services. This helped drastically with performance on M1 Macs where Docker was extremely slow.
            
            ***FFLiveParse*** (Golang/C#/Javascript)<br>
            *https://github.com/chompy/ffliveparse_server*<br>
            *https://github.com/chompy/ffliveparse_act_plugin*<br>
            
            Web application for viewing real-time game play statistics for the popular online video game, Final Fantasy XIV. At its peak usage the application on had 10-20 concurrent users, and processed about 200,000 log lines per hour.

            ***CProxy & CProxy-Cache*** (Golang)<br>
            *https://github.com/chompy/cproxy*<br>
            *https://github.com/chompy/cproxy-cache*

            HTTP/FastCGI proxy with a cache extension. The cache is meant as a very simple and lightweight substitute to Varnish and supports edge side includes (ESI).

            ***Libchomp*** (C++)<br>
            *https://github.com/chompy/libchomp*

            A simple 2D game library utilizing SDL2. Created as a learning exercise to better familarize myself with C++, game development, and library creation. It is worth noting that a game built with this library was ported to Android.
