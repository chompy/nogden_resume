            - Learned about various vector databases (ChromaDB, Typesense, Pgvector, FAISS, and Pinecone) used to store text embeddings and perform similarity searches.
            - Experimented with ways to convert various documents (DOCX, XLS, PDF, etc) to plain text and to split them in to chunks so that they could be fed in to a large language model while still maintaining important context.

            - Engineered a tool with Golang and Docker to allow engineers to setup local development environments with one simple command. (See *Platform.CC* below).
            - Crafted a new tool related to the above mentioned Platform.CC called PBrew that allowed for more a more performant local development environment, particularly on M1 Macs where Docker was not very performant. PBrew did away with containerization and used Homebrew to install and manage services.

(See *OncoLife Survivorship Care Plan* below).
            - Further researched and expanded upon the above mentioned decision tree concept by building an application with Golang and React which allowed PDF files to be populated based on how a user filled out a form. It also supported more complex rule logic with Lua.
